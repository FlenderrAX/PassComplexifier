<h1 id="title" align="center">PassComplexifier</h1>

<p id="description">Have you ever pawned an account? Me yes and it was not the best quarter of an hour that I spent. So I thought of a quick little script I could do. And yes why not complicate the passwords that we had done before so that they are almost impossible to find. Let me explain today thanks to Python and a few modules on it I managed to create a password complexification script. With the Levenshtein and Random module I was able through the input of a user to make the password more difficult the script will ask you the distance between the initial password and the generated one to then generate a list of passwords passes that are within the specified distance. Thanks to this the password will no longer be like the one before and will make it more difficult for people with malicious intentions.</p>
